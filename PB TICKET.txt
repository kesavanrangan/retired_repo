VM Creation Automation

All this while, the VM deployment was done manually by the L2 support team using the VmWare console. This would take manual hours until the VM gets created and deployed.

An automation idea will be implemented so as to over-come the manual work and avoid errors.




This was consuming time upto 10 minutes considering the manual activity mentioned in the Description. This time can be saved and utilized for other activities.



Terraform - Terraform is a scripting idea developed by Hashicorp uses Key-Value pairs with having the vsphere client connectivity.

A terraform script is now in place that uses the passed in arguments from a different script that can enable creating a VM as per the requirements which will be passed in as arguments to the actual terraform script.

This helps creating and deploying new VM within minutes and majority of the work explained here takes place in an automated way. A document has been attached that will help us understand the flow behind this process.
